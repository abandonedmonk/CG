# Aim: 
To implement DDA algorithms for drawing a line segment between two given end points.

# Objective: 
Draw the line using (vector) generation algorithms which determine the pixels
that should be turned ON are called as digital differential analyzer (DDA).It is one of the
techniques for obtaining a rasterized straight line. This algorithm can be used to draw the line
in all the quadrants.

# Theory:
DDA algorithm is an incremental scan conversion method. Here we perform calculations at
each step using the results from the preceding step. The characteristic of the DDA algorithm
is to take unit steps along one coordinate and compute the corresponding values along the
other coordinate. Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA) algorithm is the simple line generation
algorithm which is explained step by step here.
