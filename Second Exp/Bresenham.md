# Aim: 
To implement Bresenham’s algorithms for drawing a line segment between two given
end points.

# Objective:
Draw a line using Bresenham&#39;s line algorithm that determines the points of an n-dimensional
raster that should be selected to form a close approximation to a straight line between two
points

# Theory:
In Bresenham’s line algorithm pixel positions along the line path are obtained by determining
the pixels i.e. nearer the line path at each step.

# Algorithm –
•	Input the two endpoints of the line, save the left endpoint in (x0 , y0) 
•	Plot the point (x0 , y0) Calculate the constants Δx, Δy, 2Δy, and (2Δy - 2Δx) and obtain the first value for the decision parameter as: p0 = 2Δy - Δx 
•	Perform the following test at each xk along the line, beginning at k = 0. 
•	If pk < 0, then the next point to the plot is (xk+1 ,  yk ) and: pk+1 = pk + 2Δy 
•	Otherwise, the next point to plot is (xk+1 , yk+1) and: pk+1 = pk + 2Δy - 2Δx 
•	Repeat step 4, (Δx – 1) times

#include<conio.h>

 printf("Enter the first co-ordinates: ");
 scanf("%d %d",&x1,&y1);
 printf("Enter the second co-ordinates: ");
 scanf("%d %d",&x2,&y2);
 dx=x2-x1;
 dy=y2-y1;
 p=2*dy-dx;
while(x1<=x2){
 putpixel(x1,y1,50);
 x1++;
 if(p<0){
 p=p+2*dy;
 }
else
{
p=p+2*dy-2*dx;
y1++;
}
}
getch();

# Conclusion: 
It is easy to implement. It is fast and incremental. It executes fast but less faster than DDA Algorithm. The points generated by this algorithm are more accurate than DDA Algorithm. It uses fixed points only.
